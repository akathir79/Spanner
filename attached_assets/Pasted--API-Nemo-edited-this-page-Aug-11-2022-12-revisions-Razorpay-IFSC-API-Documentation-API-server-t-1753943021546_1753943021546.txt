Notes

    For an invalid IFSC code a 404 is returned.
    The contact field can either be a string or be null. It will be a E.164 formatted number as per best-effort (ie, wherever possible).
    The MICR/SWIFT code can either be a string or null. If you notice an invalid string (such as "" or "NA", please file an issue).
    The API supports CORS, so you make requests directly from the frontend
    The RTGS/NEFT enablement is based on the IFSC's inclusion in RBI's NEFT/RTGS datasets
    The IMPS flag is enabled for all IFSCs by default, unless known otherwise (such as in the case of RBI Bank)
    The BANK and BANKCODE fields are based on sublet branches, and may not necessarily match the bank name that you were expecting. For eg, since YESB0DNB002 is used by Delhi Nagrik Sehkari Bank, we return DENS as the bank code (and not YESB).
    The UPI field is based on NPCI's UPI Live Member list.
