## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Context-based auth provider with JWT-like session management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Development**: ESM modules with tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Location Data**: Local JSON file (`shared/states-districts.json`) containing authentic Indian government district data for all states, with API endpoint `/api/districts/:stateName` for real-time access

### Key Design Decisions

**Monorepo Structure**: The application uses a monorepo approach with shared schema and types between client and server, reducing code duplication and ensuring type safety across the full stack.

**Component-First UI**: Leverages Radix UI primitives wrapped in Shadcn/ui components for accessibility and consistency while maintaining customization flexibility.

**Type-Safe Database**: Drizzle ORM provides full TypeScript integration with the database schema, ensuring compile-time safety for database operations.

2. System generates and stores OTP (development returns fixed "123456")
3. OTP verification creates/updates user session
4. Automatic redirection to role-specific dashboard (admin/worker/client)
5. Home page redirects logged-in users to their dashboards

### Service Discovery Flow
1. Client searches for services by category, location, or keywords
2. System filters available workers based on location and service type
3. Client can view worker profiles, ratings, and availability
